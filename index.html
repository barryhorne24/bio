               <p>In the past few months, I have grown to understand that I enjoy daily inspiration. And I love reading scriptures everyday because it adds motivation to my to mind and thoughts. </p>
               <p>Devon Franklin has been somewhat apart of my daily inspiration. I enjoy looking at his sermons and on youtube and seeing his daily inspirational tweets. Devon Franklin brings inspiration to many people of faith around the country. His purpose is to bring people closer to jesus christ. And not only to bring people closer to jesus, but he alone puts all his trust in jesus and lives for him.  </p>
